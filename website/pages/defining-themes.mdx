# Defining Themes

We've already seen the typical case where you define your theme
using default properties.  You can include theming options for as
many components as you need to.

<Snippet
  file="SimpleTheme.jsx"
  caption="Simple Theme"
  expand
/>

## Theming Function

You can also theme a component using a function.  The function will
be passed any properties that have been specified with the component.
It should return a new set of properties that will be applied to the
component.

In this example, the `Amplifier` can set a `quiet` property which will set
the volume to `5`.  Otherwise it's set to `11`.  Notice how the function is
now overriding any `volume` property that is set on the component `props`.
Setting the volume explicitly has no effect, as seen on line 16.

<Example
  Component={ThemeFunction}
  code={ThemeFunctionSrc}
  caption="Theming Function"
  highlightLines="8,16"
  expand
/>

## Default Properties

It's up to you if your function should override any properties specified with
the component or accept them.  In the previous example the theming function
returns a new set of props where the `volume` is set *after* the current
`props` are included.  This has the effect of overriding any `volume` property
explicitly set on the component.

Changing the order so that the `volume` is set *first* changes the behaviour
to give precedence to the explicit property.  The `volume` set from the `quiet`
property effectively becomes the default value which can still be overridden,
as show on line 16 in this example.

<Example
  Component={ThemeDefaults}
  code={ThemeDefaultsSrc}
  caption="Theming Function"
  expand
/>

  Note that this behaviour is a breaking change between versions 0.x.x and
  1.x.x.  Previously (version 0.x.x) a theming function would only return the
  additional properties that it wanted to add and these would always be applied
  *after* the explicit properties.  Now it must return *all* the properties that
  it wants to be set on the component.  This new behaviour gives more flexibility
  in allowing the theming function to add, update or delete properties, and
  to determine the order in which explicit values and default values should be
  applied.
