# Defining Themes

We've already seen the typical case where you define your theme
using default properties.  You can include theming options for as
many components as you need to.

<Snippet
  file="SimpleTheme.jsx"
  caption="Simple Theme"
  expand
/>

## Theming Function

You can also theme a component using a function.  The function will
be passed any properties that have been specified with the component.
It should return a set of properties that will be applied to the
component.

In this example, the `Amplifier` can set a `quiet` property which will set
the volume to `5`.  Otherwise it's set to `11`.  Notice how the function is
now overriding any `volume` property that is set on the component.

<Example
  Component={ThemeFunction}
  code={ThemeFunctionSrc}
  caption="Theming Function"
  expand
/>

## Default Properties

I's up to you if your function should override any properties specified with
the component or accept them.  In the previous example the theming function
looks to see if the `quiet` property has been specified. If it has then it
sets the `volume` to `5` with no exceptions.  Setting the `volume` to `6`, as
shown on line 15, has no effect.

You can write the theming function to accept any values specified as
properties if you prefer.  In this next example the `volume` is only set in
cases where an explicit property is not provided.  Now we can override the
volume if necessary as show on line 15.

<Example
  Component={ThemeDefaults}
  code={ThemeDefaultsSrc}
  caption="Theming Function"
  expand
/>
