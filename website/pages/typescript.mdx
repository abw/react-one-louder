# Typescript

## Typed Theme

Let's assume that you've got some React components that have types (or
interfaces) defined for their properties.  Here's one such example.

<Snippet
  file="Alert.tsx"
  caption="Alert.tsx"
  expand
/>

You've probably got a number of these components that you'll want to combine
into a single theme type.  This defines the properties that can be passed
to the theme provider to customise your components.

<Snippet
  file="UIProps.ts"
  caption="MyUIProps.ts"
  expand
/>

You can then import the `Themer` function and call it to create your own
theming engine.  Specify your combined theme type as a type generic.

<Snippet
  file="UITheme.tsx"
  highlightLines="4"
  caption="MyUITheme.ts"
  expand
/>

This returns an object that has a `Provider` context provider and a `Themed`
Higher Order Component wrapper function.  You might choose to give them
explicit named exports, as shown here.

You can then use the `Themed` function (aliased to `MyUIThemedComponent` here)
to create a wrapper around your UI components.

<Snippet
  file="UIComponent.tsx"
  caption="MyUIComponents.ts"
  highlightLines="6-8"
  expand
/>


Use the provider to wrap your application.  Any properties that
you specify to the provider should match those in the composite theme typed.

<Snippet
  file="UIProvider.tsx"
  expand
/>

Inside the scope of the provider, your themed components will be fed the
default values.  In this example, the `MyThemedButton` component on line 7
will have the `color` property set to `blue`.

It can be a bit cumbersome listing all the theme configuration options as
separate properties passed to the provider component.  You can define them
separately and then spread them into the provider properties.  You'll need to
cast them to your theme config type.

<Snippet
  file="UIProvider2.tsx"
  highlightLines="4,14"
  expand
/>

## Work in Progress

This library was originally written to make it easy to retrospectively apply
properties to a library of React UI components.  It was written in "regular"
Javascript-flavoured React and was intended to be used as the theming engine
for another "regular" Javascript-flavoured React UI library.  It worked well.
It did the job it was supposed to do.  It made some hard things possible, even
easy.

The problem is that all the cool kids today want to use Typescript, myself
included (although it's been a long time since I was one of the cool kids).

It's only fair to state at this point that I have somewhat mixed feelings
about Typescript.  There's a lot to like about it, but I personally don't buy
into all of the fanboy hype that surrounds it. Yes, it's great to have the
option to add static types to Javascript and there's no doubt that it can help
to catch silly mistakes that might otherwise slip through the net.  But it's
good to remember that Typescript is really just a *compile-time* typing system
that's bolted onto an untyped dynamic language.

<div class="grid-3 gap-8">
  ![old man](old-man.jpeg)
  <div class="cols-2">
    The "compile-time" part is important because Typescript **does not exist** at
    runtime.  The types are removed from your code during the transpilation from
    Typescript to Javascript.  It's like having someone checking ID at the door
    to make sure everyone in the club is over 18.  It gives the sense of security
    but doesn't stop the under-18s from sneaking in through the side door.

    If you want true type safety then use a language with a proper type system like
    Rust or Haskell.  There's a saying that if your Rust program compiles then it
    probably works.  If your Typescript program compiles then there's a good chance
    that it still doesn't work, because it's Javascript under the hood with all
    its flaws.  Typescript makes Javascript better, but nowhere near perfect.

But, "old man yells at clouds" type-safety rant aside, Typescript has one
killer feature that is worth the price of admission: the IDE / Intellisense
support.  Yes, I know you can do this with JSDoc (and have done so myself),
but while you're doing that you might as well convert it to Typescript and be
done with it.

However, writing Higher Order Components for React that also work
with Typescript is *challenging* to say the least.  At least it is for me.
If I was writing this from scratch with Typescript in mind then I might do
things slightly differently.  But I'm not, so I can't.  I have to, and want to,
keep this module working the way it always has (more or less), because it works
well (more or less).  But it is based on the premise of injecting properties
into React components at runtime, not compile time.  As a result, it's cutting
across the grain of how Typescript works to a certain degree.

So be warned that Typescript purists might want to yak into their almond milk
decaffeinated lattes when they use this module.  Sorry about that.  I did my
best with the limited knowledge and skills available to me at the time.  If
you have any suggestions about how it can be improved then please let me know.
