# Theming Components

Consider a simple React component like this `Amplifier`

<Snippet
  file="Amplifier.jsx"
  expand
/>

If you don't explicitly provide a `volume` property when you use it then it
defaults to 10.

<Example
  Component={DefaultAmp}
  code={DefaultAmpSrc}
  caption="Default Volume"
  undent={2}
  expand
/>

Of course you can always provide a `volume` property to override the default
value.

<Example
  Component={AmpWithVolume}
  code={AmpWithVolumeSrc}
  caption="Explicit Volume"
  undent={2}
  expand
/>

## Themed Components

That's all very well as long as you remember to set the volume explicitly
every time.  Apart from being easy to forget, it's also hard to change.  If
you've got lots of places where you're using this component then you've got
lots of code you need to change if someone decides they want to change the
volume across the whole site.

This is where the `Themed` function can be used. Instead of exporting your
original component, wrap it up in a call to `Themed` and provide a name that
you can reference it by.

In most cases, this will be the same name as the component, but it doesn't
have to be.

<Snippet
  file="ThemedAmplifier.jsx"
/>

You can still use it just like you did before.

<Example
  Component={DefaultThemedAmp}
  code={DefaultThemedAmpSrc}
  caption="Default or Explicit Volume"
  undent={4}
  expand
/>

## Theme Provider

When you need that extra push over the cliff, you can define add a
`Theme.Provider` to inject new defaults into your themed components.
This can be anywhere in your code but it's usually best to put it somewhere
near the "top" of your application so that it encloses all the components
that want to use it.

You provide it with a new set of defaults for any components that you're
using and they will automatically be applied to your `Themed` components
matching the name.

Remember, this only sets the default values for properties.  You can still
provide an explicit `volume` when you use the component if you need to.

<Example
  Component={CustomThemedAmp}
  code={CustomThemedAmpSrc}
  caption="Festival.jsx"
  expand
/>
