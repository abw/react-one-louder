# Component Substitution

You can use the theming engine to substitute one component for another.
Consider the case where we have a special kind of amplifier.

<Snippet
  file="MarshallAmplifier.jsx"
  caption="Marshall.jsx"
  expand
/>

Your band has just signed a lucrative sponsorship deal with an amplifier
manufacturer.  Wherever you were using an `Amplifier` you want to swap it
out for the new branded `Marshall`.

## Render Function

You can define your theming function to render the new component and
return the result.  You don't need to change any of your application
code.  The theming engine takes care of swapping one component for
another.

<Example
  Component={ComponentSwap}
  code={ComponentSwapSrc}
  caption="Render Component"
  expand
/>

<Info
  title="Note"
  icon="info"
  border
  className="mar-t-4"
>
  The function is called with 3 arguments.  The first is the object
  of properties, shown here as `props` .  The second is any
  `ref` that should be forwarded to the component.  The third
  is the complete theming `context` in case you need to look up
  any other theming rules.

## Substitute Component

As a shortcut you can define the theme entry to be an array containing
the substitute component as the first element.  This is ideal for those
cases where you just want to substitute one component for another but
with all the other properties remaining the same.

<Example
  Component={ComponentSwap2}
  code={ComponentSwap2Src}
  caption="Substitute Component"
  expand
/>

## Substitute With Defaults

You can also provide a set of default properties as the second element.

<Example
  Component={ComponentSwap3}
  code={ComponentSwap3Src}
  caption="Substitute With Defaults"
  expand
/>

## Substitute With Function

Or the second element can be a theming function.

<Example
  Component={ComponentSwap4}
  code={ComponentSwap4Src}
  caption="Substitute With Function"
  expand
/>
