# Variants

The `variants` function provides an easy way to define multiple variants for
a component.

For example, we might want to define different `Amplifier` configurations
based on the `musician` property.

For the `Amplifier` theme options, we
call the `variants()` function passing it an object.  The keys in the object
are properties that can be set on the component.  The corresponding values
are the properties that will be added.  So if the `musician` is set to `nigel`
then we set the `volume` property to `11`, the `name` to `Nigel` and the
`instrument` to guitar.

<Example
  Component={Variants}
  code={VariantsSrc}
  caption="Variants"
  expand
/>

As usual, these only provide default values for the component.  You can still
override them by specifying explicit property values.  So if Derek is
performing a blistering bass solo in free-form jazz exploration in front of
a festival crowd then he can still crank his amp up to 11, as shown on line
32.

Here's the enhanced `Amplifier` component for this example.

<Snippet
  file="NamedAmplifier.jsx"
/>

## Multiple Variants

You can define multiple variants.  For example, we might want to separate
the properties associated with a `musician` from those relating to the
`intensity`.

<Example
  Component={Variants2}
  code={Variants2Src}
  caption="Multiple Variants"
  expand
/>

## Variant Shortcuts

You can also use boolean `true` values (which you get from React if you
specify a property without a value) as a shortcut to set properties.

In this example we use `loud`, `loudish` and `quiet` as boolean properties
that are shortcuts to set the `volume` property.

<Example
  Component={Variants3}
  code={Variants3Src}
  caption="Variant Shortcuts"
  expand
/>
