  If you can see... the numbers all go to eleven. Look... right
  across the board. Eleven... eleven... eleven. You see, most blokes
  will be playing at ten. You&apos;re on ten here... all the way up,
  all the way up. You&apos;re on ten on your guitar... where can you
  go from there? Where? Nowhere. Exactly. What we do is if we need
  that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do? Put it up to
  eleven. Eleven. Exactly. One louder.
